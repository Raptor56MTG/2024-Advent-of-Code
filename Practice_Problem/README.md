# Warm up

I will be doing the 2015 Day 1 Advent of code problem here. This is just for practice to ensure my environment is set up and working before Day 1 begins.

I will likely be commenting things that don't need commenting. This is to help myself better understand and remember things. I don't have a ton of experience with JavaScript in Node.js, and my main experience has been with using it in browsers more than anything. I installed libraries using a cdn (content deliver network), grabbing common libraries like chart.js, bootstrap, jquery, and more. This is in place of things like npm (network package manager)
